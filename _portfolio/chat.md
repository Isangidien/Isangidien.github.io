## Explanation

BlocChat, a functional chat room to communicate with others. This was the second project that I worked on at Bloc. Built using HTML, CSS, Firebase,
and AngularJS to produce a real-time chat application.

## Implementation

AngularJS was the framework on which I built this web application. AngularJS was then linked to Firebase a back--end-database, which allowed a storage system for created chatrooms and their associated messages. Users of the chat room are able to create a username, which is stored for future use via cookies. 

## Results

The result is a fully-functional chatroom, which, for the amount of functionality, was built in a very short amount of time because of the ease of both the Angular framework and the Firebase database.

## Conclusion

BlocChat offers convenience and simplicity to users who want to connect with friends, family members and peers digitally. Using AngularJS provided a powerful framework that worked perfectly for developing a real time digital communication room.
