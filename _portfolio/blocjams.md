## Explanation

BlocJams, a digital music player like Spotify.  This was the first project that I worked on at Bloc. Built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery to produce a responsive, and easy-to-navigate website that can play music from a library.

## Implementation

This site was built with easy in mind, it allows users to navigate from album to album and song to song to find and play music.
Initially built just using basic HTML and CSS, but then with use of JavaScript and jQuery library functionality and animation was added. Once complete the codes were refactored using AngularJS. 

## Results

The result is an attractive and responsive website where users can listen and enjoy ad-free streamable music.   

## Conclusion

Bloc Jams is an effective digital music service application streamable on all platforms and advertisement-free. This project allowed me to showcase the basic front-end-building skills that I have learned to produce a great looking website that functions much like a basic version of Spotify.
