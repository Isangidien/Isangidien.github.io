title: My goals at Bloc
---

  My goal for starting a coding bootcamp might seem obvious,         <strong>learn to code</strong>. <br>
  But it's so much more, not only do I want to learn and be able to code, I also want to be confident learning the fullstack even though I have little to no experience with front and backend languages.

After completing Bloc I hope to be a part of a great team of like minded people; using my new skills in programing to change workplace learning, and write codes that have an impact. I am also looking forward to being a part of a community of coders, turning programing logic into something concrete in the form of a website with lots of moving parts.
