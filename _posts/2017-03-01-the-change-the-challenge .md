There are many things that I am certain about myself and three of them are my passion for knowledge, my ability to teach, and my strong interpersonal skills.
I've been teaching or working in learning and development for the majority of my adult working life, it has taught me the importance of staying up to date with technology in order to better help the next generation.

It became apparent after I was affected by a layoff that I should take the opportunity to learn a skill in the technology field. I wanted a formal education in web development, without being in a classroom and with the flexibility I needed. And so the hunt for the right web development program started. I narrowed my choices down to three different programs but I loved the idea of working at my own pace online and meeting with mentor to help me on my new adventure. And so I knew that Bloc would be the right choice for me and  my web development education.
